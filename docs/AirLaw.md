## 1 - Basic regulation definition and certification specification  definitions. Binding / not binding

Basic Regulation - Binding
Certification Specification - Non Binding, aims to comply with Basic regulation but an alternative
specification may be proposed as long as it follows the basic regulation.

## 2- During a flight from US to Germany, while over the UK, Germany does not accept the flight. Is it legal? Or the should have it been done earlier?

It's legal. States maintain their sovereignty and can close their airspace at
any time for exceptional reasons (Think USA in 9/11)

## 3- ASHTAM elements?

https://flightcrewguide.com/wiki/meteorology/ashtam-format/

ASHTAM provides a `colour code`

- Green: Volcanic activity has ceased
- Yellow: Active from time to time
- Orange: Active with plume up to FL250
- Red: Active with plume above FL250

## 4- In what document can you find rules regarding parallel rwy operations?

ICAO Doc 9643 Manual on Simultaneous Operations on Parallel or
near parallel Instrument Runways (SOIR).

## 5 - What equipment is needed for a parallel approach?

In theory, the only special equipment is 2 separate VHF radios so that you can
be in simultaneous contact with TOWER and RADAR. The first is issuing clearances,
the second is monitoring your approach and will give you commands if you need
to perform an evasive maneuver or if you are in risk of violating the NTZ.

## 6 - when is operator obliged to compensate passengers according to convention of montreal mc99?

When delay time is over 5h or when the flight is canceled (according to Regulation 261/2004)

## 7 - Your aircraft is on fire! Can you land on a closed runway for administrative reasons?

For safety reasons you can land on a closed runway.

## 8 - What is the purpose of RCC?

A rescue co-ordination centre (RCC) is a primary search and rescue facility in a
country that is staffed by supervisory personnel and equipped for coordinating
and controlling search and rescue operations.

## 9 - Which privileges gives you the aerobatic rating?

Qualifies license holder to perform aerobatic maneuvers in the type of A/C used
for training.

## 10 - registration nationality mark. Is this the common mark?

No. Different things.

Common Mark is attributed to ICAO by the ITU, which in turn delegates its
attribution to a common mark registry authority. Common mark is used by Operators
who are registered in more than one country.

National mark is attributed to a country by ITU and ICAO is informed of this.

## 11 - when is SAR available?

H24. This is one of the basic requirements for all signatory members of the ICAO.

## 12 - EU Regulation 373 (2017). What is it about?

Basically it's The implementation of Annex 10 and 11.
- General and specific requirements for the provision of Air Navigation Services.
- Specific requirements for the provision of ATS, meteorological services, AIS, Communication Navigation and Surveillance services.

## 13 - EU Regulation 965 (2012). What is it about?

Basically it's The implementation of Annex 6. It specifies rules for all types
of commercial and non-commercial operations.

> This Regulation lays down detailed rules for commercial air transport
> operations with aeroplanes and helicopters, including ramp inspections of
> aircraft of operators under the safety oversight of another State when landed
> at aerodromes located in the territory subject to the provisions of the Treaty

## 14 - EU Regulation 376 (2014). What is it about?

Follow up and dissemination of occurrences

## 15 - Definition of rating

Approval on a license which states CONDITIONS, PRIVILEGES OR LIMITATIONS
relating to that license.

## 16 - Two aircraft on radials 10 and 30 outbound, both 15 nm from the fix. They are separated  if the fix is a ... if the fix is

a) Vor
b) Adf
c) Dme
d) Tacan

Answer: VOR

When flying on a fix radial, 2 aircraft are considered to be separated if they
are, at a distance of 15 NM, with 15º separation if the fix is a VOR, 30º if a
fix is a NDB, and 45º if Dead reckoning is being used.

- DME : Incorrect, since a DME can't get a bearing.
- ADF : Incorrect, since it uses NDB, so 30º would be needed
- TACAN: Incorrect, since it only provides distance information for civil aircraft.

## 17 - Definition of flight safety document system

https://skybrary.aero/articles/safety-documentation

> The purpose of the SMS documentation is to document the safety management
> system (SMS) of the organisation and communicate it internally to staff and
> externally to the organisations concerned, for example to the regulator.
> It enables the correct execution of safety procedures and thus the achievement
> of the organisation’s safety objectives.

## 18 - Is the CMC paper only, computer readable or both?

Machine readable only. (It's just a card with a magnetic band)

## 19 - While on NAT HLA airspace with a Mach number assigned, you encounter turbulence. Should you reduce speed and inform ATC, or mantain your speed and request a slower speed from ATC?

If pilots need to change their Mach Number, usually because of turbulence,
ATC must be informed at the earliest possible. This allows ATC to consider and
remedy any threat to separation. So, first you change the speed, and inform ASAP.

## 20 - What happens if an aircraft is cleared to land  and tower doesn't see it.

Most likely nothing. This scenario is perfectly common under LVO.

## 21 - If gps coordinates of an airport change permanently. How is this informed. NOTAM or AIP amendment?

AIP amendment since it's a permanent change.

## 22-  list of frangible markers

- fixed/temporary/permanent objects that were marked: **False**
- location signs on runway: **Correct**
- signs on paved runway and: **Correct**
- signs/lights on unpaved runway: **Correct**

## 23 - From where are crossbars and approach lights measured from.

Threshold.

## 24 - How are NOTAMs distributed?

NOTAMs are publicly available and distributed through telecommunications, so
the expect the best answer to be **"distributed through Internet"**.

## 25 - Hijacked A/C should ATC approve A/C to takeoff to save lives or deny takeoff clearance to prevent greater hazard/threat to human life?

Takeoff clearance to hijacked aircraft can be given in the interest of preserving human life.
